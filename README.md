# French oral aid software using the Fourier transform and Neural Networks

Detection and evaluation of pronunciation accuracy of consonant pairs in spoken French.

`Specified for voiceless/voice fricatives consonants.`

Train and test the model in the file `nn_model.py`.

### Description of the project :

In French some pairs of consonants are difficult to pronouce differently, especially for kids and French learners.
This project aims to help those people with the pronouciation of these consonants. Once the Neural Network is trained, the user provides a recording of them saying one consonant. Then the
program outputs the predicted consonant for the recording, the percentage of accuracy and energy comparing them with the aimed results.
