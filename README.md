# French oral aid software using the Fourier transform and Neural Networks

Detection and accuracy evaluation of pairs of consonants in oral French.

Specified for voiceless/voice fricatives consonants.

Description of the project :

In French some pairs of consonants are difficult to pronouce differently, especially for kids and French learners.
This project aims to help those people with the pronouciation of these consonants. When a pair of consonants
is selected, the user has to provide a recording of them saying one of the two consonants selected. Then the
program outputs the predicted consonant for the recording, the percentage of accuracy, voicing, constriction 
and energy comparing them with the aimed results.
